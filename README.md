# WMFO Mindtouch Scraper

## Purpose

We used this to dump our old mindtouch wiki. The result is displayed in the WMFO/wiki repository here on Github.

There's a php script that walks the XML file generated from the mindtouch API. We also dumped the files and then put everything under directories for easier navigating. Files are hosted on wiki-files.wmfo.org

It's not particularly pretty but it works since mindtouch abruptly stopped supporting their wiki stack.

I hope someone else finds this useful :)
